# Propeller 2 Standard Library
(this doc still needs work)

The Propeller 2 Standard Library (libp2) is intended to provide an implementation of common Propeller 2 features and functions for the P2LLVM toolchain. It attempts to use as much of the standard `propeller.h` and `propeller2.h` as possible. It also provides all of the necessary startup code for booting a Propeller program compiled with the P2LLVM toolchain. This document should serve as a rough documentation of the library, with formal documentation to follow. 

libp2 is automatically linked by `clang/ld.lld`.
