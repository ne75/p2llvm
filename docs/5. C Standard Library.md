# C Standard Library

P2LLVM contains an implementation of the C Standard Library, taking most of its implementation from propgcc, with modifications to support Propeller 2. It is intended to serve as a standalone library that does not have to be linked to the program (although there's generally no reason to do that). All startup code (including initializing this library, if linked), resides in the P2 Standard Library. 

Most of the libraries implementation has not been tested, as there is too much to test at once. However, it does succesfully compile. A lot of os-level features have been removed (such as making directories and such) as the P2 does not have a filesystem.
