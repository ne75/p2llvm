# 64 Bit Support

To make 64-bit relatively efficient, we define the upper 16 general purpose registers (r16-r31) as 8 virtual 64-bit registers (r16:r17, etc). We'll define a few basic operations on the 64 bit numbers as psuedo instructions (specifically, loading and storing). Common operations (speciically, those defined in libgcc: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Integer-library-routines.html#Integer-library-routines), will be LibCalls. More complex operations will be expanded by LLVM. We won't define the "long" versions, since `int` and `long` are the same on P2. 

There's no "add" or "subtract" libcall in gcc, but we have `ADDX` to automatically add in the carry flag from a previous `ADD`, so we can do a very simple 64 bit add:

```
// to add a 64 bit in r16:r17 to a 64 bit in r18:r19 (and store in r16:17):
add r16, r18        // if we overflow, c is set 
addx r17, r19       // r17 += r19 + c
```

We COULD just make this a pseudo instead since it requires adding custom libcall logic to LLVM

## Load/Store Pseudos

Loading is done using a fast block transfer from a hub address, to an even numbered register (r16 or greater). Storing is the opposite.
