# 64 Bit Support

To make 64-bit relatively efficient to work with, 16 64-bit pseudo-registers are defined. They are named R0_R1, R2_R3...R30_R31, based on the underlying subregisters. This way, all LLVM operations are done in the backend on these 64 bit registers until the final instruction lowering passes. Pseudo instructions are defined to operate on 64 bit registers, which are then converted to real instructions operating on the underlying 32 bit subregisters. LLVM's subregister model allows us to do all this right before register allocation, which helps avoid wasting copying between a fake 64 bit register and a real 32 bit register. 

The following pseudos are defined. Each can take an immediate or a register for the second operand
- `MOVi64`: move an immediate into a 64 bit register
- `RDDLONG`: read a 64 bit value from memory into a 64 bit register
- `WRDLONG`: write a 64 bit register to memory.
- `ADD64`: add two 64 bit values
- `SUB64`: subtract two 64 bit values
- `AND64`: bitwise and two 64 bit values
- `OR64`: bitwise or two 64 bit values
- `XOR64`: bitwise xor two 64 bit values
- `SEXT64`: sign extend a 32 bit register into a 64 bit register
- `SEXTIR64`: sign extend a 64 bit value in-register
- `ZEXT64`: zero extend a 32 bit value into a 64 bit regsiter

Other 64 bit operations are either expanded during DAG lowering, or turned into a runtime library call (see [4. Propeller 2 Standard Library](4.%20Propeller%202%20Standard%20Library.md)).
