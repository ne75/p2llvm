# Floating Point Support

Floating point support is achieved by using the soft-fp library from [glibc](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/tree/master/soft-fp). A simple `sfp-machine.h` is added for the necessary defines. It was copied from propgcc and cleaned up a little bit. 

Since these functions are large, they will not fit in LUT RAM where the rest of the runtime library lives. So, basic wrapper functions are places in the rtlib that just call the actual function that lives in HUB RAM. This means that floating point math **cannot** be used in a cog-mode function that is utilizing the streamer/hub FIFO hardware. This is rarely to be required, but something to keep in mind.
