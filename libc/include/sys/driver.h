/**
 * Typedef for the _Driver struct
 * 
 * This struct is used by stdio. It lets a program define custom devices.
 *
 * @see __driver for more information on custom devices.
 *
 * @note This structure is included by <stdio.h>, so we cannot
 * pollute the namespace with definitions; use underscores in
 * front of names

/**
 * @brief Generic and customizable driver struct for stdio devices.
 *
 * @details
 * The purpose is to allow replacing the stdio functions.
 * Any device can be attached to stdio functions with this struct.
 *
 * Typically the __driver array is defined by users for setting up
 * stdin, stdout, stderr FILE drivers, SD card FILE drivers, and others.
 *
 * The _Driver list is a list of all drivers we can use in the program.
 * The default _InitIO function opens stdin, stdout, and stderr based
 * on the first driver in the list (typically the serial driver).
 * The serial driver could be replaced by a TV/Keyboard driver.
 * 
 * When defined by the user, the array of structs may look like this:
 * @verbatim

extern _Driver _SimpleSerialDriver;

_Driver *_driverlist[] = {
  &_SimpleSerialDriver,
  NULL
};

 @endverbatim
 * The NULL driver ends the _Driver list.
 *
 * The device driver interface is the __driver struct.
 * By defining the struct in the device driver, one connects driver
 * functions to the _Driver.
 *
 * In a TV output device driver for example, we need to define
 * fopen() for the _InitIO() routine, fwrite(), and fclose().
 *
 * @verbatim

_Driver TvDriver = {
  TvPrefix,     // TvPrefix is the device driver name "TV"
  Tv_fopen,     // fopen starts the TV COG (term for Propeller core).
  Tv_fclose,    // fclose stops the TV COG if necessary, etc....
  _null_read,   // use _null_read instead of defining Tv_fread
  Tv_write,     // fwrite is used to send characters to the TV
  NULL,         // seek; not applicable
  NULL,         // remove; not applicable
  NULL,         // getbyte; not applicable
  Tv_putbyte,   // putbyte: write a single byte
};

 @endverbatim
 *
 * Of course it is not necessary to use a stdio method for TV output.
 * There are some cases where the stdio infrastructure is not necessary.
 * The standard stdio library is relatively big, but as small as possible.
 * 
 * The __driver mechanism gives the program flexibility in a standard way.
 * The types of drivers are limited only by the programmer's imagination.
 *
 * Some VGA demo programs have been written entirely in C.
