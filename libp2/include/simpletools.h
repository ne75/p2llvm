 * @brief This library provides convenient functions 
 * for a variety of microcontroller I/O, timing, conversion, and  
 * communication tasks.  This library also includes (and you can 
 * call functions from) 
 * <a target="blank" href="html/../../../Text%20Devices/libsimpletext/
 * Documentation%20simpletext%20Library.html">simpletext</a> 
 * and
 * <a target="blank" href="html/../../../Text%20Devices/libsimpletext/
 * Documentation%20serial%20Library.html">serial</a>.  
 *
 * @details This library provides a set of introductory functions that simplify:
 *  
 * @li I/O control - convenient I/O pin monitoring and control functions
 * @li Timing - Delays, timeouts
 * @li Timed I/O - pulse generation/measurement, square waves, transition
 * counting, RC decay, etc.
 * @li Analog - D/A conversion, PWM, and more.  
 * @n For A/D conversion see ...Learn/Simple Libraries/Convert
 * for A/D conversion libraries
 * @li Serial Communication - SPI, I2C
 * @n For half and full duplex asynchronous serial communication, see 
 * ...Learn/Simple Libraries/Text Devices
 * @li Memory - EEPROM, SD storage
 *
 * Applications include: monitoring, control and
 * communication with simple peripherals, like lights, buttons,
 * dials, motors, peripheral integrated circuits and prototyping with
 * simple systems that use pulse, or serial communication.  (A few
 * examples from the very large list of devices includes: servos,
 * ultrasonic distance sensors, accelerometers, serial liquid crystal,
 * display, etc.)
 *
 * Intended use: Accompanies introductory electronics, robotics and
 * programming lessons and projects on learn.parallax.com.  After
 * these lessons, bridge lessons will be added to familiarize the
 * programmer with standard practices used by the community for
 * adding libraries to support and endless variety of peripherals
 * and applications.
 *
 * @par Core Usage
 * Any of these functions, if called, will launch a process into another cog
 * and leave it launched for set it/forget it processes:
 * 
 * @li cog_run (1 cog per call)
 * @li squareWave (1 cog)
 * @li pwm (1 cog)
 * @li dac (1 cog)
 *
 * @par Memory Models
 * Use with CMM or LMM.
 * 
 * @version
 * 1.1.8 Add constrainFloat, constrainInt, mapFloat, mapInt, and random.  
 * @par
 * 1.1.7 Update pause function for up to 2,147,483,647 ms.  
 * @par
 * 0.98.2 Add term_cmd function for SimpleIDE Terminal cursor, screen, and audio
 * control.  
 * @par
 * 0.98 fpucog floating point coprocessor no longer self-starts by default.  
 * All floating point functionality is still supported, processing just happens in
 * the same cog.  i2c_out and i2c_in char regAddr parameter changed to int memAddr. 
 * itoa removed, use sprint(charArray, "%d", intVal) to make int to ASCII 
 * conversions.  st_msTicks and st_usTicks global variables are pre-initialized to the 
 * number of system clock ticks in a millisecond and microsecond for convenience in
 * library development.  Variables named us and ms are initialized to the same values 
 * for user applications.  Function endianSwap added to simplify communication with 
 * devices that send/receive byte data in big endian format.
 * @par
 * 0.97 Add cog_run and cog_end for simplified running of functioncode in other cogs.
 * @par
 * 0.96.1 Add documentation for start_fpu_cog and stop_fpu_cog.
 * @par
 * 0.96 ee_putStr updated to support 128 byte page writes.  More corrections to ee_put
 * for contiguous data crossing address/128 boundary.
 * @par
 * 0.95 square_wave bug that prevented output frequency changes
 * (fixed).
 * @par
 * 0.94 Fixed bug in ee_put* that prevented contiguous data from crossing the EEPROM's 
 * address/128 buffer boundaries.  Updated stack array to static in mstimer.c.
 * @par
 * 0.93 i2c_newbus now uses @n
 *   .../Learn/Simple Libraries/Protocol/simplei2c/@n 
 * Added:@n
 *   i2c_out, i2c_in to cover most common I2C applications
 * EEPROM ee_get_* and ee_put_* changed to ee_get* and ee_put* where 
 * the * term is camel-case.
 * @par
 * 0.92 Simpletext functionality incorporated for use of
 * character and string I/O with both terminal and peripheral devices.
 * Simple Text folder replaces PropGCC serial driver support for simple
 * and full duplex serial peripherals.
 * @par
 * 0.91 shift_in function pre-clock mode bug fixed. @n @n
 * 
 * @par Help Improve this Library
 * Please submit bug reports, suggestions, and improvements to this code to
 * editor@parallax.com.

 * high for 3/4 of its cycle with pwm_set(pin, channel, 750).  If the

 * the motor will behave as though it's only getting 3/4 of the supply

 *
 * @param pin I/O pin to send the PWM signal.  You can change this
